### What Was Accomplished

1. **✅ Django Backend Integration**
   - Successfully integrated Django backend with custom HTML/CSS/JS frontend
   - Removed all notice/announcement functionality as requested
   - Created proper admin dashboard for menu management

2. **✅ Branch-Based Menu Management**
   - Admin can manage menu items for different restaurant branches
   - Pagomo branch correctly identified in database (slug: `rabbit-hole-pagomo`)
   - Menu items can be added, edited, and deleted through admin interface

3. **✅ Menu Categories**
   - Updated to requested categories: All, Grills, Stews+Sides, Snacks, Sides
   - Category filtering works on both Pagomo and Rabbit Hole pages
   - Dynamic category buttons generated from database

4. **✅ Real-Time Menu Updates**
   - Menu items added by admin appear immediately on user-facing pages
   - No caching issues - changes are reflected instantly
   - Both Pagomo and Rabbit Hole pages load menu items dynamically from database

5. **✅ Key Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed critical branch slug mismatch (was searching for 'pagomo', actual slug is 'rabbit-hole-pagomo')
   - Fixed template URL errors in admin forms
   - Fixed menu item visibility and filtering

```

### Admin Workflow
1. Admin logs in to `/login/`
2. Accesses dashboard at `/dashboard/`
3. Selects branch for menu management
4. Can add/edit/delete menu items for that branch
5. Changes appear immediately on user-facing pages

### User Experience
1. Users visit `/pagomo/` or `/rabbithole/`
2. Menu items are loaded dynamically from database
3. Category filtering works (All, Grills, Stews+Sides, Snacks, Sides)
4. All menu items display with proper formatting

### Technical Implementation
- Django 5.2.4 with SQLite database
- CORS headers enabled for API communication
- Template system for HTML rendering
- RESTful admin interface
- Real-time data updates (no caching delays)

### Testing Scripts Created
- `test_complete_flow.py` - Tests complete admin workflow
- `test_pagomo_view.py` - Tests Pagomo page rendering
- `setup_menu_data.py` - Sets up sample menu data
- Various Django management commands for debugging

### Final Status
**The integration is complete and working as requested:**
- ✅ Admin can manage menu items for branches
- ✅ Changes appear immediately on user pages
- ✅ Menu filtering works correctly
- ✅ All notices/announcements functionality removed
- ✅ Menu categories updated as requested
- ✅ Django backend properly serves frontend

The system is ready for production use. Admin users can now manage restaurant menus through the Django admin interface, and all changes will be reflected immediately on the customer-facing Pagomo and Rabbit Hole pages.
